# The Aether Sages
As established in the Constitution of the Aether Nation [Article 1, Section 3](https://github.com/AetherNation/constitution/blob/main/constitution.md), the Judicial power of the government shall be vested in the Aether Sages.

## Structure
The Aether Sages consist of seven judges called Sages, with one of them being designated as the leader, the Grand Sage. Members of the Aether Sages retain their position for their entire life. Their membership is terminated at death or resignation. When a new Sage needs to be selected, the selection will be made by the Grand Sage, with the House of Elementals' approval. A new Grand Sage is chosen by the previous one, should the previous one have resigned. If the last Grand Sage is deceased, the Aetherlord will select a new Grand Sage.

## Powers of the Aether Sages
The Aether Sages serve as the highest court of the Aether Nation, with the responsibility of presiding as the judgment over cases that reach the high court and ensure that all government activity remains within the Constitution's bounds. The Grand Sage of the Aether Sages also has the responsibility of overseeing the Aether Sages' judicial activity, leading the House of Elementals' legislative action, and performing coronations of new Aetherlords.
